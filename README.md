## PHP code to log IP's and a tutorial on how to set up for noobs
To grab someones IP he has to click on a link.<br>
Nowdays everyone knows the basic iplogger.com and other iplogger links,<br>
thats why I made a easy solution for noobs!<br>
Watch this __**[tutorial](https://youtu.be/e-S5b-yFLis)**__ on how to set up 000webhost.<br>
After you are done drag the index.php file into your website,<br>
and send the url to your victim.<br>
After the victim clicks on it the IP should be in logs.txt
